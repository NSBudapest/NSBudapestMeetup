**Zsolt Kolbay - Writing your own computer language for fun and profit**

Learn how to create your own programming language in Swift with [ANTLR](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/swift-target.md)!
ANTLR [(ANother Tool for Language Recognition)](http://www.antlr.org/) is an open-source tool helps you define the grammar of your language and process it in Swift.
This presentation will show you how to create a [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) interpreter with a syntax like this:

`repeat 5 { forward 150 left 144 }`

**GÃ¡bor Bakos ([Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.hu)) - Static Code Analysis with Clang on iOS**

Magical bugs and where to find them.

Everybody wants to be as fast as possible. Develop features then ship, pronto, while at the same time obtaining feedback, gathering findings and improving everything. Static code analysis is a tool besides the classic tests to help you out in your journey. My talk will be about the Clang framework's diagnostic possibilities and how you can leverage them in order to produce better software.
