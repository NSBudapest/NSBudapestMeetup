**Pedro Piñera (iOS engineer [@SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)): Framework Oriented Programming**

I have a proposal about a topic I've been working on the last months. I created a reference for an architectural approach for Xcode project that I called "Framework Oriented Programming". The idea behind this architecture is organizing your apps in reusable local frameworks. Single purposes pieces of code, that could be shared on multiple platforms and by multiple products.

The reference is on [this](https://github.com/pepibumur/framework-oriented-programming) repository whose points would be explained in the talk.

**Radek Pietruszewski (Software writer [@Nozbe](https://nozbe.com)): Dependent Types (and other ideas for guaranteeing correctness with types)** 

A few strategies for protecting yourself from your future self's mistakes. Write more robust code by expressing constraints in the type signature and avoiding partial functions. Give your compiler the tools it needs to assist you. Let it help you.
