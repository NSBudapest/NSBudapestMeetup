**Gergo Nemeth (iOS developer [@Supercharge](https://supercharge.io)):  Apple TV Development**

Last year Apple introduced the fourth generation Apple TV and with that a new operating system called tvOS.
The new platform offers the ability for developers to create and submit application to the new tvOS App Store.

In this talk I’ll introduce you this platform: we’ll talk about the core concept of tvOS, the concept of navigation and some development related topics too.
