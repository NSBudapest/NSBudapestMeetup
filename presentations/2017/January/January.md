**Inga RÃ¼b: "What do you gain with -O flag?"**

I would like to focus on high-level optimizations offered by the Swift-LLVM compiler. The main goal would be to describe mechanisms behind such concepts as: classes, generics, closures and to explain how to boost their performance. Also, I will discuss circumstances in which the compiler is able to improve the code on its own as well as situations that require an additional initiative from software developers.
