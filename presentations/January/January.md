**Károly Lőrentey (indie dev), What about Swift?**

Swift is Apple's recently created programming language with no source or link-time compatibility, or even a working compiler. In this extremely serious talk for professional software engineers, we are going to take a quick look at the current state of the Swift language, compiler and ecosystem.

*Karoly originally started mobile programming for Palm OS. After being sidetracked as an employee of Charles Simonyi and then LogMeIn, he is now back on mobile platforms, as an intrepid indie developer wannabe on iOS. He hasn't shipped anything yet, and would you please stop asking him about a ship date.*

**István Csanády (Shapr3D), How we redesigned the 3D modeling user experience from the ground up for the iPad Pro?**

[Shapr3D](http://www.shapr3d.com/) is a 3D modeling app for the iPad Pro. I will talk about the challenges of UI/UX design of a very complex application, about designing our interface for the Apple Pencil and multitouch interaction. I will briefly talk about the technical challenges of developing a CAD application on a mobile platform, about our technology stack, and about our experiences with the iPad Pro's amazing ARMv9 CPU.

*Istvan is a software engineer and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder and CEO of Shapr3D.*

**Péter Wiesner (Skyscanner), Mobile engineering at the brink of scale**

Besides the giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter only a few smaller companies are able to work at scale. Skyscanner Budapest stepped on this exciting journey last year and set the goal: enable more and more engineers inside the company to work together on Skyscanner’s apps but at the same time keep our pace and fix release schedule that allows us iterative development.

My presentation aims to be an insider-tour in Skyscanner’s engineering culture and more specifically in the daily routine of our Budapest-based mobile app development team: we are 40 engineers working to satisfy the needs of over 40 million travellers. It is also a story about how we slowly evolved from coders to product engineers whose most important job is to creatively solve complex problems.

We haven't reached the end of our journey yet, however we think that our first learnings can be interesting for others.

*Peter is a passionate software engineer. For the last 5 years he has worked in iOS development and contributed to the birth of several state of the art mobile applications under the flag of a Hungarian start-up, Distinction. Since the company’s acquisition by leading travel search engine Skyscanner in 2014, he has been leading iOS development teams and could also release his dream project, Dixie as the company’s first open source library.*
