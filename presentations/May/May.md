**Arpad Goretity (freelance iOS dev): Non-Pessimizations in the Swift compiler**

I'd like to propose a talk about some interesting findings I've come across recently while studying the source of the Swift compiler.

Topics that will be covered:

- A brief, lightweight introduction to the architecture of the Swift compiler, with special regards to the SIL CFG and SSA, for those unfamiliar with these concepts
- The importance of normalization of IR, and why I say "non-pessimization" rather than "optimization"
- Three interesting and clever non-pessimizations:
  - ARC optimizations
  - inout shadow variable elimination
  - Unification of closures and free functions.
