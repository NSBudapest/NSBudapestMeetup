Code
----

We created a coding exercise from a dummy Todo app. The project was to fill out the tests, or missing pieces of code in the app to turn the tests green. Check the git history for more details. :)

Please follow the installation instructions in the projects' Readme, especially in case of the Swift version, since there's a difference in case of using older version of Xcode.
